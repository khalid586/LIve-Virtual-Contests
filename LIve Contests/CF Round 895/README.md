|<details> <summary> **Hint**</summary>  Think about the difference of A and B </details>                                             |   <details> <summary> **Hint**</summary>  Think about the time it takes to return to the point someone is starting from </details>      |     <details> <summary> **Hint**</summary>If a number is non-prime then it will be definitely the sum of two numbers </details>         |    <details> <summary> **Hint**</summary> Think about positions which will add to the sum and positions that will be subtracted from the sum and positions that are common. Then maximize the positive positions and minimize the negative positions. </details>                  |
|<details> <summary> **Explanation**</summary>If a number is non-prime then it is the sum of quotent and (dividend-1) * quotent. So you just have to find a number that is non-prime within the given range. If you don't find then answer is -1. </details>                                |    <details> <summary> **Explanation**</summary>We have to calculate the max distance(from every point) we can go and that will be = current position + (b-1)/2 . Then we will find the minimum and that will be the answer.</details>                                                     |      <details> <summary> **Explanation**</summary> difference between a and b should be halfed because to make the difference zero if a is decreased by 1 then b will also increase by 1 so the change in difference will be 2. And if there is remainder we will need an extra attempt so we have to add 1 to it. </details>                                          |   <details> <summary> **Explanation**</summary> You have to maximize n/x positions and minimize the n/y positions , so we will give n/x positions largest values and n/y positions smallest values and we will count the sum of the elements by using (n*(n+1))/2 formula. Then we will count the difference of maximized and minimized elements.</details>
