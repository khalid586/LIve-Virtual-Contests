## Problems

#### Problem A
- [Problem Link](https://codeforces.com/contest/1872/problem/A)
- <details> <summary> Hint</summary>  Think about the difference of A and B</details>
- [Solution](https://github.com/khalid586/LIve-Virtual-Contests/blob/main/LIve%20Contests/CF%20Round%20895/CF%201872A.cpp)
- <details> <summary> Explanation</summary> difference between a and b should be halfed because to make the difference zero if a is decreased by 1 then b will also increase by 1 so the change in difference will be 2. And if there is remainder we will need an extra attempt so we have to add 1 to it. </details>

#### Problem B
- [Problem Link](https://codeforces.com/contest/1872/problem/B)
- <details> <summary> Hint</summary>  Think about the time it takes to return to the point someone is starting from</details>
- [Solution](https://github.com/khalid586/LIve-Virtual-Contests/blob/main/LIve%20Contests/CF%20Round%20895/CF%201872B.cpp)
- <details> <summary> Explanation</summary>We have to calculate the max distance(from every point) we can go and that will be = current position + (b-1)/2 . Then we will find the minimum and that will be the answer.</details>

#### Problem C
- [Problem Link](https://codeforces.com/contest/1872/problem/C)
- <details> <summary> Hint</summary>If a number is non-prime then it will be definitely the sum of two numbers </details>

#### Problem D
- [Problem Link](https://codeforces.com/contest/1872/problem/D)
- <details> <summary> Hint</summary> Think about positions which will add to the sum and positions that will be subtracted from the sum and positions that are common. Then maximize the positive positions and minimize the negative positions.</details>
